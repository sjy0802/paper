**Abstract:** Amidst the vigorous development of smart transportation and the acceleration of building a strong transportation nation,
the intelligent upgrade of highway service areas has become a critical issue in the transportation industry. This paper analyzes the 
development needs of smart service areas based on the current status of service areas and proposes a construction plan centered on smart
traffic management and control, using a holographic perception system as the foundational architecture. The plan includes five major 
application systems: a smart parking system, parking guidance system, service area traffic volume detection system, intelligent crosswalk
system, and personnel tracking system. The Ningyang Service Area is used as an engineering demonstration point to illustrate the implementation
of the plan, aiming to provide a reference for the intelligent upgrading of highway service areas.
